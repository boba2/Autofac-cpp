# Autofac-cpp

Playground for discovering new C++-14 constructs and possibilities.

The aim is to mimic in C++ the popular C# dependency injection framework Autofac.
It seems that template programing alongside with the SFINAE allows for convenient compile-time type/method/constructor reflection.
The usage of the framework is well exemplarized in the thorough unit tests.
